= Spring LDAP Repositories

Spring LDAP has built-in support for Spring Data repositories. The basic functionality and configuration is described https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-commons/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories[here]. When working with Spring LDAP repositories, you should remember the following:

*  You can enable Spring LDAP repositories by using an `<ldap:repositories>` element in your XML configuration or by using an `@EnableLdapRepositories` annotation on a configuration class.

*  To include support for `LdapQuery` parameters in automatically generated repositories, have your interface extend `LdapRepository` rather than `CrudRepository`.

*  All Spring LDAP repositories must work with entities that are annotated with the ODM annotations, as described in <<odm>>.

*  Since all ODM managed classes must have a Distinguished Name as the ID, all Spring LDAP repositories must have the ID type parameter set to `javax.naming.Name`.
   The built-in `LdapRepository` takes only one type parameter: the managed entity class, defaulting the ID to `javax.naming.Name`.

*  Due to specifics of the LDAP protocol, paging and sorting are not supported for Spring LDAP repositories.

[[querydsl-support]]
== QueryDSL support
Basic QueryDSL support is included in Spring LDAP. This support includes the following:

*  An annotation processor, called `LdapAnnotationProcessor`, for generating QueryDSL classes based on Spring LDAP ODM annotations. See <<odm>> for more information on the ODM annotations.

*  A Query implementation, called `QueryDslLdapQuery`, for building and running QueryDSL queries in code.

*  Spring Data repository support for QueryDSL predicates. `QueryDslPredicateExecutor` includes a number of additional methods with appropriate parameters. You can extend this interface along with `LdapRepository` to include this support in your repository.
