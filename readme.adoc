= Spring LDAP

Spring LDAP is a library to simplify LDAP programming in Java, built on the same
principles as Spring Jdbc. 

The LdapTemplate class encapsulates all the plumbing work involved in traditional LDAP 
programming, such as creating, looping through NamingEnumerations, handling Exceptions
and cleaning up resources. This leaves the programmer to handle the important stuff - 
where to find data (DNs and Filters) and what to do with it (map to and from domain
objects, bind, modify, unbind, etc.), in the same way that JdbcTemplate relieves the 
programmer of all but the actual SQL and how the data maps to the domain model.

In addition to this, Spring LDAP provides Exception translation from NamingExceptions
to an unchecked exception hierarchy, as well as several utilities for working with filters,
LDAP paths and attributes.

For detailed information on the project, please refer to the [reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/current/reference/) and [javadocs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/docs/2.3.x/apidocs/).
See [the changelog](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ldap/releases) for detailed information on changes in the latest version.

== Code of Conduct

By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Downloading Artifacts
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/reference/getting-spring-ldap.html[Getting Spring LDAP] for how to obtain Spring LDAP.

== Documentation

Be sure to read the https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/reference/[Spring LDAP Reference].
Extensive JavaDoc for the Spring LDAP code is also available in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-ldap/site/docs/current/api/[Spring LDAP API Documentation].

You may also want to check out https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ldap/releases[the change log for new features].

== Building from Source

Spring LDAP uses a https://gradle.org[Gradle]-based build system.
In the instructions below, https://vimeo.com/34436402[`./gradlew`] is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.

=== Prerequisites
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git[Git] and the https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17[JDK17 build].

Be sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk-17` folder extracted from the JDK download.

=== Check out sources
[indent=0]
----
git clone git@github.com:spring-projects/spring-ldap.git
----

=== Install all `spring-*.jar` into your local Maven repository.

[indent=0]
----
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
----

=== Compile and test; build all JARs, distribution zips, and docs

[indent=0]
----
./gradlew build
----

The reference docs are not currently included in the distribution zip.
You can build the reference docs for this branch by running the following command:

----
./gradlew :spring-ldap-docs:antora
----

That command publishes the docs site to the `_docs/build/site_` directory.
The https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ldap/tree/docs-build[playbook branch] describes how to build the reference docs in detail.

Discover more commands with `./gradlew tasks`.
