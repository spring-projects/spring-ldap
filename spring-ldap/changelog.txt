Changes in version 1.2.1 (Dec 2007)
-------------------------------------------
* Added pooling library which features flexible connection validation
  and better configuration than the built-in pooling. (LDAP-85)

* Fixed a problem in AbstractContextSource which led to an unnecessary
  reference to the LDAP Booster Pack (ldapbp). (LDAP-88, LDAP-89)

* Added missing package description and updated copyright. (LDAP-92)

* Added build instructions. (LDAP-27)

* Fixed bug in SimpleLdapTemplate where the wrong target method was being
  called. (LDAP-93)

* Made createContext in AbstractContextSource protected rather than
  package private. (LDAP-94)

Changes in version 1.2 (Oct 2007)
-------------------------------------------
A number of API-breaking changes have been made in the 1.2 release compared to version 1.1.2.
Consequently this is NOT a drop-in replacement for Spring LDAP 1.1.2,
though upgrading should not present all that much work. Please see
the supplied upgrade guide for details.

* Added getContextSource on LdapTemplate.

* The following getters on AbstractContextSource have been added:
    getContextFactory
    getDirObjectFactory
    getAuthenticationSource
    getUrls (was protected)
    isPooled
    isAnonymousReadOnly

* Upgraded to Spring 2.0.6 internally. Spring 1.2.x is still supported.

* Reviewed all javadoc.

* Revised reference manual.

* AbstractConnection source now actively removes pooling flag from context environment
  if pooling is set to 'false'. (LDAP-83)

* AcegiAuthenticationSource now supports anonymous authentication. (LDAP-67)

* Added BaseLdapPathSource, BaseLdapPathAware and BaseLdapNameBeanPostProcessor to be used 
  if the ContextSource base path is needed by beans. There is now also a DistinguishedNameEditor 
  available for directly injecting DistinguishedName instances to beans. (LDAP-86)

* Added immutableDistinguishedName() method in DistinguishedName to get an immutable
  copy of the instance. (LDAP-87)
  
* Added easier access methods for RDN attributes and values. (LDAP-71)

* Added lookupContext() and alternate modifyAttributes() in LdapOperations/LdapTemplate
  to simplify updates. (LDAP-78)
  
* Modified append() method in DistinguishedName. This method now returns the instance, to
  enable more fluent building of DistinguishedNames. (LDAP-74)
  
* Added SimpleLdapTemplate providing Java 5 generics support. (LDAP-72)

* Added AbstractContextMapper implementation. (LDAP-76)

Changes in version 1.2-RC1 (5.12.2007)
-------------------------------------------
A number of API-breaking changes have been made in this release,
mainly package restructuring stuff (LDAP-33). Consequently this is
NOT a drop-in replacement for Spring LDAP 1.1.2, though upgrading
should not present all that much work. Please see the supplied
upgrade guide for details.

* Restructured packages (LDAP-33):
  - Moved the core classes into the package ldap.core.
  - Moved subpackages of ldap.support to top level.
  - Moved most classes in ldap.support to ldap.core or ldap.core.support.
  - Moved classes in ldap.utils to ldap.support and removed ldap.utils.

* Changed the exception hierarchy to be an unchecked mirror of the JNDI
  NamingException hierarchy (LDAP-4).

* Deprecated the userName property in AbstractContextSource and changed
  it to the more correct userDn (LDAP-18).

* Fixed bug causing PagedResultsRequestControl processing to fail against AD 
  in the case of a PartialResultsException (LDAP-32).

* Fixed bug causing NullPointerException in some environments when performing
  PagedResultsRequestControl search (LDAP-37).

* Implemented client-side transaction support for Spring LDAP. See reference
  documentation for further information (LDAP-29).

* DirContextAdapter.setAttribute() now properly updates updatedAttrs in update mode
  (resulting in ModificationItems if applicable) (LDAP-15).
  
* Exceptions thrown by Spring LDAP are now always Serializable, regardless of whether
  the wrapped NamingException is (which is not always the case) (LDAP-14).
  
* LdapRdnComponent now implements Serializable (LDAP-45).

* Rewrote LdapEncoder.nameDecode() to solve problem with national characters and
  remove regular expression used in parsing, drastically improving Distinguished Name
  parsing performance as a bonus (LDAP-30).

* The DefaultDirObjectFactory.JNDI_ENV_BASE_PATH_KEY has been deprecated. If the base
  property needs to be accessed from a subclass to AbstractContextSource, use the new
  protected method getBase (LDAP-55).
  
* LdapContextSource.getAnonymousEnv no longer sets a broken ResponseControlFactory in
  the environment (LDAP-64).
  
* Upgraded ApacheDS to 1.0.0 (LDAP-32).

* Upgraded to Acegi Security 1.0.3 (LDAP-61).

* Upgraded to ApacheDS 1.0.0 (LDAP-32).

* Upgraded to Spring 2.0.4 internally. Spring 1.2.x is still supported (LDAP-35, LDAP-51).

* Upgraded to Spring WebFlow 1.0.2 in the Person sample (LDAP-60).

* Fixed a number of documentation errors and typos (LDAP-41, LDAP-40, LDAP-47, LDAP-48).
  
* Extracted useful inner classes from LdapTemplate to top-level classes (LDAP-42).

* Implemented addAttributeValue and removeAttributeValue in DirContextAdapter (LDAP-5).

* Modified DirContextOperations interface so that getNameInNamespace doesn't throw NamingException.

* Fixed NullPointerException when getting PagedResultsRequestControl response (LDAP-66).

* Rewrote logic i DirContextAdapter.getModificationItems(). The JNDI provider's Attribute
  comparison logic is now used internally. Also, REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE items are placed
  first in the ModificationItem array, in order to prevent ATTRIBUTE_ALREADY_EXIST errors
  (LDAP-13, LDAP-46).
  
* In internal integration tests, each test now runs on a clean LDAP database (LDAP-43).

* DirContextProcessor#postProcess() is now called in searches regardless of whether an 
  exception is thrown (LDAP-26).
  
* Moved SortControlDirContextProcessor to spring-ldap from sandbox (LDAP-68).


Changes in version 1.1.2 (1.12.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Fixed problem with DirContextAdapter.getNameInNameSpace. Now it really
  returns the full DN.

* There is now a wrapper class called PagedResult, which can be used to
  wrap the resulting list and the PagedResultsCookie after using
  PagedResultsRequestControl.

* The actual cookie in PagedResultsCookie is now immutable.

* The person sample is now a Spring WebFlow application, where the user
  can manage persons and standard LDAP access groups.

* Improved javadoc for DefaultDirObjectFactory and DistinguishedName.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0.1 internally. Spring 1.2.8 is still supported.

Changes in version 1.1.1 (18.11.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Added capability to use server-side controls in search by leveraging
  DirContextProcessor.

* Added generic DirContextProcessor that is run before and after a search.

* Added paged search result functionality in PagedResultsRequestControl,
  which is an implementation of DirContextProcessor.

* Fixed problem with DirContextAdapter, where the wrong change was applied
  when a change was followed by a reset to the original values.

* DirContextAdapter.getNameInNamespace() now returns the full DN, as per the
  documentation for javax.naming.Context.

* The parsing of DistinguishedName has been changed from using regexp to
  a JavaCC parser, which means improved performance (5-6 times faster) and
  better error messages.

* DistinguishedName now supports multi-valued RDNs separated by a '+' sign,
  like "cn=Rod+sn=Johnson", for example. All according to spec 2253.

* LdapRdn is now Serializable.

* Added lookup methods that take an array of return attribute names.

* Made DistinguishedName.EMPTY_NAME an immutable DistinguishedName instance.

* Separated integration tests that require OpenLDAP from the other integration
  tests that run the in-JVM Apache DS server.

* Changed the spring-ldap-person sample application to authenticate and
  authorize against groups rather than role attributes.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0 internally. Spring 1.2.8 is still supported.

Changes in version 1.1 (28.8.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Changed base package from net.sf.ldaptemplate to org.springframework.ldap

* Changed package ...support.acegi to ...support.authentication

* Replaced SearchResultCallbackHandler with NameClassCallbackHandler
  to enable its use in all search operations (search, list, listBindings).
  Changed all references and implementing classes accordingly, 
  including name changes where applicable:
  ** CollectingSearchResultCallbackHandler was replaced by CollectingNameClassPairCallbackHandler.
  ** CountSearchResultCallbackHandler was replaced by CountNameClassPairCallbackHandler

* Added NameClassPairMapper for use with list operations

* Added DefaultNameClassPairCallbackHandler.

* Added DefaultValuesAuthenticationSourceDecorator to enable default authentication
  information when AuthenticationSource returns empty values.

* ContextSource implementations now creates authenticated Contexts by default,
  since the previous behaviour has proven to be confusing.
  The authenticatedReadOnly flag was replaced by an anonymousReadOnly flag.
  
* AbstractContextSource now defaults the dirObjectFactory property to DefaultDirObjectFactory.

* Added search methods to LdapTemplate for specifying return attributes.

* Added list and listBindings methods to LdapTemplate.

* Fixed bug in AbstractContextSource regarding java version number and base path.

* Improved javadocs.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-rc3.

* Added full reference documentation.

Changes in version 1.0.2 (LdapTemplate) (26.6.2006)
------------------------------------
* Added methods in LdapTemplate to unbind recursively.

* Added rename() method to LdapTemplate.

* Fixed bug in getPrefix() of DistinguishedName.

* Fixed bug in getModificationItems() of DirContextAdapter.
  The method now correctly handles changes of individual vales in
  multi-value attributes.
  
* Introduced AbstractContextSource, moved the code from LdapContextSource there
  and made LdapContextSource and DirContextSource inherit from this.
  
* Upgraded to Acegi 1.0.0. Removed classes no longer needed:
  LdapTemplateLdapAuthenticationProvider
  LdapTemplateUserDetails
  *NOTE*:
     This means that configuration needs to be changed if using Acegi,
     since the API and package structure has changed in Acegi between
     versions 1.0.0-RC2 and 1.0.0 final.
  

Changes in version 1.0.1 (LdapTemplate) (5.5.2006)
-----------------------------------
* Now checking whether the first argument to getObjectInstance in
  DefaultDirObjectFactory is a Context, and if so, closing it properly.

* Fixed reference to non-existent ContextSourceImpl in ldaptemplate-person.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-m4.

* Upgraded DDSteps to 1.1-rc1 and EasyMock to 1.2.

Changes in version 1.0 (LdapTemplate) (24.4.2006)
----------------------------------
* Introduced the AuthenticationSource interface to enable other strategies for
  retrieving principal and credentials than a hard-coded username/password.

* Added the AcegiAuthenticationSource implementation for retrieving a previously
  authenticated principal and credentials using Acegi.

* Added a 'cacheEnvironmentProperties' property that enables the user to choose
  whether to cache the environment HashMap or to re-create it each time a new
  Context is created.

* Added an ignorePartialResultException to LdapTemplate which causes all
  PartialResultExceptions to be ignored during searches, for use when working
  against Active Directory, which cannot handle referrals correctly.

* Added search methods in LdapOperations (and LdapTemplate) that take a
  parameter for SearchControls.

* The methods getNamesOfModifiedAttributes, update, and getAttributeSortedStringSet
  in DirContextOperations (and DirContextAdapter) no longer throw NamingException.
  Instead, they throw unchecked DataAccessExceptions.

* The method getModificationItems in AttributeModificationsAware no longer throws
  NamingException. Instead, it throws unchecked DataAccessExceptions.

* Removed the (unused) 'task' parameter to NamingExceptionTranslator.translate.

* Removed the deprecated ContextSourceImpl class.

* Integration tests now run using an in-memory version of Apache Directory Server,
  rather than requiring a working installation of a directory server.

* Integration tests now run together with pure unit tests under the 'tests' Ant target.

* The ldaptemplate-person sample web application now uses an in-memory version of Apache
  Directory Server, rather than requiring a working installation of a directory server.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-m3.

* The build now uses Ivy 1.3.1.

Changes in version 1.0-RC2 (LdapTemplate) (22.2.2006)
--------------------------------------
* LdapV2 is now supported. 
  ContextSourceImpl has been deprecated. In stead the new 
  LdapContextSource should be used for LdapV3 and a DirContextSource 
  has been added for LdapV2 compatibility.
  
* Ability has been added in LdapContextSource and DirContextSource 
  to specify that an authenticated context should be used for 
  read-only operations as well. Use property 'authenticatedReadOnly'
  in LdapContextSource/DirContextSource.
  
* The Filter classes have been cleaned up.

* DirContextAdapter has been cleaned up. Most important to note is that
  in this operation the 'setStringAttribute/setStringAttributes' methods 
  have been removed and replaced by 'setAttributeValue/setAttributeValues'.
  
* Base DNs are now correctly URL encoded when building the connection String.
  This means that spaces and other 'unsafe' characters in base DNs should no
  longer be manually URL encoded.

* An AttributesIntegrityViolationException has been added and is thrown when
  an InvalidAttributesException is encountered.
  
* More unit tests have been added.

Changes in version 1.0-RC1 (LdapTemplate) (27.1.2006)
--------------------------------------
* First public release candidate.
