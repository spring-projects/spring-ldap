Changes in version 1.2 (xx.yy.2007)
-------------------------------------------
* Moved the core classes into the package ldap.core.

* Deprecated the userName property in AbstractContextSource and changed
  it to the more correct userDn.

* Upgraded ApacheDS to 1.0.0.

Changes in version 1.1.2 (1.12.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Fixed problem with DirContextAdapter.getNameInNameSpace. Now it really
  returns the full DN.

* There is now a wrapper class called PagedResult, which can be used to
  wrap the resulting list and the PagedResultsCookie after using
  PagedResultsRequestControl.

* The actual cookie in PagedResultsCookie is now immutable.

* The person sample is now a Spring WebFlow application, where the user
  can manage persons and standard LDAP access groups.

* Improved javadoc for DefaultDirObjectFactory and DistinguishedName.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0.1 internally. Spring 1.2.8 is still supported.

Changes in version 1.1.1 (18.11.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Added capability to use server-side controls in search by leveraging
  DirContextProcessor.

* Added generic DirContextProcessor that is run before and after a search.

* Added paged search result functionality in PagedResultsRequestControl,
  which is an implementation of DirContextProcessor.

* Fixed problem with DirContextAdapter, where the wrong change was applied
  when a change was followed by a reset to the original values.

* DirContextAdapter.getNameInNamespace() now returns the full DN, as per the
  documentation for javax.naming.Context.

* The parsing of DistinguishedName has been changed from using regexp to
  a JavaCC parser, which means improved performance (5-6 times faster) and
  better error messages.

* DistinguishedName now supports multi-valued RDNs separated by a '+' sign,
  like "cn=Rod+sn=Johnson", for example. All according to spec 2253.

* LdapRdn is now Serializable.

* Added lookup methods that take an array of return attribute names.

* Made DistinguishedName.EMPTY_NAME an immutable DistinguishedName instance.

* Separated integration tests that require OpenLDAP from the other integration
  tests that run the in-JVM Apache DS server.

* Changed the spring-ldap-person sample application to authenticate and
  authorize against groups rather than role attributes.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0 internally. Spring 1.2.8 is still supported.

Changes in version 1.1 (28.8.2006)
-------------------------------------------
* Changed base package from net.sf.ldaptemplate to org.springframework.ldap

* Changed package ...support.acegi to ...support.authentication

* Replaced SearchResultCallbackHandler with NameClassCallbackHandler
  to enable its use in all search operations (search, list, listBindings).
  Changed all references and implementing classes accordingly, 
  including name changes where applicable:
  ** CollectingSearchResultCallbackHandler was replaced by CollectingNameClassPairCallbackHandler.
  ** CountSearchResultCallbackHandler was replaced by CountNameClassPairCallbackHandler

* Added NameClassPairMapper for use with list operations

* Added DefaultNameClassPairCallbackHandler.

* Added DefaultValuesAuthenticationSourceDecorator to enable default authentication
  information when AuthenticationSource returns empty values.

* ContextSource implementations now creates authenticated Contexts by default,
  since the previous behaviour has proven to be confusing.
  The authenticatedReadOnly flag was replaced by an anonymousReadOnly flag.
  
* AbstractContextSource now defaults the dirObjectFactory property to DefaultDirObjectFactory.

* Added search methods to LdapTemplate for specifying return attributes.

* Added list and listBindings methods to LdapTemplate.

* Fixed bug in AbstractContextSource regarding java version number and base path.

* Improved javadocs.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-rc3.

* Added full reference documentation.

Changes in version 1.0.2 (LdapTemplate) (26.6.2006)
------------------------------------
* Added methods in LdapTemplate to unbind recursively.

* Added rename() method to LdapTemplate.

* Fixed bug in getPrefix() of DistinguishedName.

* Fixed bug in getModificationItems() of DirContextAdapter.
  The method now correctly handles changes of individual vales in
  multi-value attributes.
  
* Introduced AbstractContextSource, moved the code from LdapContextSource there
  and made LdapContextSource and DirContextSource inherit from this.
  
* Upgraded to Acegi 1.0.0. Removed classes no longer needed:
  LdapTemplateLdapAuthenticationProvider
  LdapTemplateUserDetails
  *NOTE*:
     This means that configuration needs to be changed if using Acegi,
     since the API and package structure has changed in Acegi between
     versions 1.0.0-RC2 and 1.0.0 final.
  

Changes in version 1.0.1 (LdapTemplate) (5.5.2006)
-----------------------------------
* Now checking whether the first argument to getObjectInstance in
  DefaultDirObjectFactory is a Context, and if so, closing it properly.

* Fixed reference to non-existent ContextSourceImpl in ldaptemplate-person.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-m4.

* Upgraded DDSteps to 1.1-rc1 and EasyMock to 1.2.

Changes in version 1.0 (LdapTemplate) (24.4.2006)
----------------------------------
* Introduced the AuthenticationSource interface to enable other strategies for
  retrieving principal and credentials than a hard-coded username/password.

* Added the AcegiAuthenticationSource implementation for retrieving a previously
  authenticated principal and credentials using Acegi.

* Added a 'cacheEnvironmentProperties' property that enables the user to choose
  whether to cache the environment HashMap or to re-create it each time a new
  Context is created.

* Added an ignorePartialResultException to LdapTemplate which causes all
  PartialResultExceptions to be ignored during searches, for use when working
  against Active Directory, which cannot handle referrals correctly.

* Added search methods in LdapOperations (and LdapTemplate) that take a
  parameter for SearchControls.

* The methods getNamesOfModifiedAttributes, update, and getAttributeSortedStringSet
  in DirContextOperations (and DirContextAdapter) no longer throw NamingException.
  Instead, they throw unchecked DataAccessExceptions.

* The method getModificationItems in AttributeModificationsAware no longer throws
  NamingException. Instead, it throws unchecked DataAccessExceptions.

* Removed the (unused) 'task' parameter to NamingExceptionTranslator.translate.

* Removed the deprecated ContextSourceImpl class.

* Integration tests now run using an in-memory version of Apache Directory Server,
  rather than requiring a working installation of a directory server.

* Integration tests now run together with pure unit tests under the 'tests' Ant target.

* The ldaptemplate-person sample web application now uses an in-memory version of Apache
  Directory Server, rather than requiring a working installation of a directory server.

* Upgraded Spring to 2.0-m3.

* The build now uses Ivy 1.3.1.

Changes in version 1.0-RC2 (LdapTemplate) (22.2.2006)
--------------------------------------
* LdapV2 is now supported. 
  ContextSourceImpl has been deprecated. In stead the new 
  LdapContextSource should be used for LdapV3 and a DirContextSource 
  has been added for LdapV2 compatibility.
  
* Ability has been added in LdapContextSource and DirContextSource 
  to specify that an authenticated context should be used for 
  read-only operations as well. Use property 'authenticatedReadOnly'
  in LdapContextSource/DirContextSource.
  
* The Filter classes have been cleaned up.

* DirContextAdapter has been cleaned up. Most important to note is that
  in this operation the 'setStringAttribute/setStringAttributes' methods 
  have been removed and replaced by 'setAttributeValue/setAttributeValues'.
  
* Base DNs are now correctly URL encoded when building the connection String.
  This means that spaces and other 'unsafe' characters in base DNs should no
  longer be manually URL encoded.

* An AttributesIntegrityViolationException has been added and is thrown when
  an InvalidAttributesException is encountered.
  
* More unit tests have been added.

Changes in version 1.0-RC1 (LdapTemplate) (27.1.2006)
--------------------------------------
* First public release candidate.
