		The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is for LDAP programming
		what Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is for SQL programming. There are
		several similarities between JDBC and JNDI/LDAP (Java LDAP). Despite
		being two completely different APIs with different pros and cons, they
		share a number of less flattering characteristics:

         		<para>They require extensive plumbing code, even to perform the simplest of tasks.</para>

         		<para>Exception handling is difficult.</para>

		</itemizedlist>

		The above points often lead to massive code duplication in common usages
		of the APIs. As we all know, code duplication is one of the worst code smells.
		All in all, it boils down to this: JDBC and LDAP programming in Java are both
		incredibly dull and repetitive.

		Spring JDBC, a part of the Spring framework, provides excellent utilities for
		simplifying SQL programming. We need a similar framework for Java LDAP programming.
