/**
 * Wrapper class to handle the full identification of an LDAP entry. An LDAP entry is
 * identified by its Distinguished Name, in Spring LDAP represented by the
 * {@link DistinguishedName} class. A Distinguished Name can be absolute - i.e. complete
 * including the very root (base) of the LDAP tree - or relative - i.e relative to the
 * base LDAP path of the current LDAP connection (specified as <code>base</code> to the
 * {@link ContextSource}).
 * <p>
 * The different representations are needed on different occasions, e.g. the relative DN
 * is typically what is needed to perform lookups and searches in the LDAP tree, whereas
 * the absolute DN is needed when authenticating and when an LDAP entry is referred to in
 * e.g. a group. This wrapper class contains both of these representations.
