/**
 * An interface used by LdapTemplate to map LDAP Contexts to beans. When a
 * DirObjectFactory is set on the ContextSource, the objects returned from
 * <code>search</code> and <code>listBindings</code> operations are automatically
 * transformed to DirContext objects (when using the {@link DefaultDirObjectFactory} -
 * which is typically the case, unless something else has been explicitly specified - you
 * get a {@link DirContextAdapter} object). This object will then be passed to the
 * ContextMapper implementation for transformation to the desired bean.
 * <p>
 * ContextMapper implementations are typically stateless and thus reusable; they are ideal
 * for implementing mapping logic in one place.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, consider using an {@link AttributesMapper} in stead.
