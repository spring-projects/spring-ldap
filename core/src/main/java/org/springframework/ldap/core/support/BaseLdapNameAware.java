/**
 * Interface to be implemented by classes that want to have access to the base context
 * used in the active <code>ContextSource</code>. There are several cases in which
 * services may want to have access to the base context, e.g. when working with groups
 * (<code>groupOfNames</code> objectclass), in which case the full DN of each group member
 * needs to be specified in the attribute value.
 * <p>
 * If a class implements this interface and a {@link BaseLdapPathBeanPostProcessor} is
 * defined in the <code>ApplicationContext</code>, the default base path will
 * automatically passed to the {@link #setBaseLdapPath(javax.naming.ldap.LdapName)} method
 * on initialization.
 * <p>
 * <b>NB:</b>The <code>ContextSource</code> needs to be a subclass of
 * {@link AbstractContextSource} for this mechanism to work.
