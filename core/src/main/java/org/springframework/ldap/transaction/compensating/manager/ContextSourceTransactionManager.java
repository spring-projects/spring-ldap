/**
 * TransactionManager for managing LDAP transactions. Since transactions are not supported
 * in the LDAP protocol, this class and its collaborators aim to provide
 * <em>compensating</em> transactions instead. Should a transaction need to be rolled
 * back, this TransactionManager will try to restore the original state using information
 * recorded prior to each operation. The operation where the original state is restored is
 * called a compensating operation.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> The transactions provided by this TransactionManager are all <i>client
 * side</i> and are by no means 'real' transactions, in the sense that we know them in the
 * ordinary database world, e.g.:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Should the transaction failure be caused by a network failure, there is no way
 * whatsoever that this TransactionManager can restore the database state. In this case,
 * all possibilities for rollback will be utterly lost.</li>
 * <li>Transaction isolation is not provided, i.e. entries participating in a transaction
 * for one client may very well participate in another transaction for another client at
 * the same time. Should one of these transactions be rolled back, the outcome of this is
 * undetermined, and may in the worst case result in total failure.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * While the points above should be noted and considered, the compensating transaction
 * approach will be perfectly sufficient for all but the most unfortunate of
 * circumstances. Considering that there currently is a total absence of server-side
 * transaction support in the LDAP world, being able to mark operations as transactional
 * in the same way as for relational database operations is surely a step forward.
 * <p>
 * An LDAP transaction is tied to a {@link ContextSource}, to be supplied to the
 * {@link #setContextSource(ContextSource)} method. While the actual ContextSource used by
 * the target LdapTemplate instance needs to be of the type
 * {@link TransactionAwareContextSourceProxy}, the ContextSource supplied to this class
 * should be the actual target ContextSource.
 * <p>
 * Using this TransactionManager along with {@link TransactionAwareContextSourceProxy},
 * all modifying operations (bind, unbind, rebind, rename, modifyAttributes) in a
 * transaction will be intercepted. Each modification has its corresponding
 * {@link CompensatingTransactionOperationRecorder}, which collects the information
 * necessary to perform a rollback and produces a
 * {@link CompensatingTransactionOperationExecutor} which is then used to execute the
 * actual operation and is later called for performing the commit or rollback.
 * <p>
 * For several of the operations, performing a rollback is pretty straightforward. For
 * example, in order to roll back a rename operation, it will only be required to rename
 * the entry back to its original position. For other operations, however, it's a bit more
 * complicated. An unbind operation is not possible to roll back by simply binding the
 * entry back with the attributes retrieved from the original entry. It might not be
 * possible to get all the information from the original entry. Consequently, the
 * {@link UnbindOperationExecutor} will move the original entry to a temporary location in
 * its performOperation() method. The commit() method will know that everything went well,
 * so it will be OK to unbind the entry. The rollback operation will be to rename the
 * entry back to its original location. The same behaviour is used for rebind()
 * operations. The operation of calculating a temporary location for an entry is delegated
 * to a {@link TempEntryRenamingStrategy} (default
 * {@link DefaultTempEntryRenamingStrategy}), specified in
 * {@link #setRenamingStrategy(TempEntryRenamingStrategy)}.
 * <p>
 * The actual work of this Transaction Manager is delegated to a
 * {@link ContextSourceTransactionManagerDelegate}. This is because the exact same logic
 * needs to be used if we want to wrap a JDBC and LDAP transaction in the same logical
 * transaction.
