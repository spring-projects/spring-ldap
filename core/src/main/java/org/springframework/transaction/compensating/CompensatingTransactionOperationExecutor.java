package org.springframework.transaction.compensating;

/**
 * Responsible for executing a single recorded operation as well as committing or rolling
 * it back, depending on the transaction outcome. Instances of this interface are
 * constructed by {@link CompensatingTransactionOperationRecorder} objects, supplying them
 * with the information necessary for the respective operations.
 * <p>
 * The actual operations performed by the respective methods of this class might not be
 * what would originally be expected. E.g. one would expect that the
 * {@link #performOperation()} method of a CompensatingTransactionOperationExecutor
 * implementation would actually delete the entry, leaving it for the {@link #rollback()}
 * method to recreate it using data from the original entry. However, this will not always
 * be possible. In an LDAP system, for instance, it might not be possible to retrieve all
 * the stored data from the original entry. In that case, the {@link #performOperation()}
 * method will instead move the entry to a temporary location and leave it for the
 * {@link #commit()} method to actually remove the entry.
